RadioSonde is a collection of programs for reading and plotting SKEW-T,log p
diagrams and wind profiles for data collected by radiosondes (the typical
weather balloon-borne instrument), which we will call "flights", "sondes", or
"profiles" throughout the associated documentation. The raw data files are in a
common format that has a header followed by specific variables. Use
"help(ExampleSonde)" for the full explanation of the data files.
